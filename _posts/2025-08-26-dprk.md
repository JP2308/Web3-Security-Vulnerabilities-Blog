## üî¥ Exploits Aren‚Äôt Random ‚Äî They Follow Patterns

- **Hot Wallet Compromise (BtcTurk $51M):** Poor key management and lack of hardware-backed security.  
- **Approval Misuse (Coinbase incident):** Human or logic errors in handling token approvals ‚Üí instantly exploited.  
- **Nation-State Social Engineering (DPRK IT Workers):** Malware-assisted intrusions through long-term impersonation campaigns.

**Auditing Takeaway:**  
Most ‚Äúhacks‚Äù don‚Äôt start with a novel zero-day ‚Äî they stem from *peripheral misconfigurations*. Audits must extend beyond contract code into **operational processes**: wallet key management, approval flows, CI/CD integrity, and developer security hygiene.

## üîç Bridging Exploits with Investigations

**Auditing Takeaway:**  
A modern auditor needs **dual skillsets**:  
1. **Proactive** ‚Äî spotting weaknesses before deployment.  
2. **Reactive** ‚Äî tracing impact after compromise and supporting recovery.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Weak Points to Flag

- **Approval Surfaces:** Lingering ERC-20 approvals create hidden attack vectors.  
- **Key Management:** Hot wallets = single point of failure. MPC/HSM should be mandatory.  
- **Social Engineering Risks:** Even the strongest code is meaningless if devops teams can be tricked.  
- **On-Chain Risk Controls:** Too many DeFi systems lack kill switches, governance-enforced limits, or abnormal flow detection.

**Auditing Checklist:**
```text
- Are approval limits enforced in the contract?  
- Is there a pausability/kill-switch mechanism?  
- Are private keys stored in HSM/MPC vs hot wallets?  
- Is there monitoring for abnormal on-chain flows?  
- Are CI/CD and containerised environments hardened against malware?  
```

Security auditing today is not just about code correctness. It‚Äôs about recognising the exploit playbooks attackers reuse, stress-testing infrastructure resilience, and ensuring that if a compromise occurs, the trail isn‚Äôt lost.
