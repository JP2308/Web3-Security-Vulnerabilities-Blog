This week‚Äôs incidents highlight a recurring theme: Web3 is only as secure as its weakest Web2 dependencies. From Loopring‚Äôs flawed guardian model to Snowflake‚Äôs SaaS breach rippling across Web3 infra, it‚Äôs clear attackers no longer see a clean line between Web2 and Web3 ‚Äî and neither should we.  


## üîí Loopring Guardian Compromise  

### Incident Overview  
Loopring provides users with additional protection against theft or loss by allowing users to define trusted "Guardians" for their wallets. These Guardians have the power to lock the wallet ‚Äî blocking unauthorised transactions from it ‚Äî or restore access to the wallet if it is lost.

Unfortunately, a single point of failure allowed attackers to bypass intended protections.  

### Attack Flow (pseudocode)  
```solidity
contract LoopringGuardian {
    struct GuardianInfo {
        address guardianAddress;
        uint256 threshold;
        bool isActive;
        uint256 lastActivity;
    }
    
    mapping(address => GuardianInfo[]) public walletGuardians;
    mapping(address => bool) public officialGuardians;
    
    // VULNERABILITY: Single point of failure
    address public constant OFFICIAL_GUARDIAN = 0x...;
    
    function addGuardian(address wallet, address guardian) external {
        require(msg.sender == wallet, "Unauthorised");
        
        // Many users defaulted to official guardian
        if (guardian == OFFICIAL_GUARDIAN) {
            walletGuardians[wallet].push(GuardianInfo({
                guardianAddress: guardian,
                threshold: 1, // Single guardian approval
                isActive: true,
                lastActivity: block.timestamp
            }));
        }
    }
    
    function executeRecovery(
        address wallet,
        address newOwner,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external {
        GuardianInfo[] storage guardians = walletGuardians[wallet];
        
        // CRITICAL FLAW: Trusts guardian without additional verification
        require(isValidGuardianSignature(wallet, signature), "Invalid signature");
        
        // Transfer wallet ownership
        _transferOwnership(wallet, newOwner);
    }
}
```

### The exploit 

1. **Reconnaissance: Identifying Vulnerable Wallets**  
   - The attacker scans through Loopring wallets.  
   - They specifically look for wallets configured with **only the official guardian** (no additional guardians).  
   - These wallets are flagged as **single points of failure**.  

2. **Crafting a Recovery Request**  
   - For each targeted wallet, the attacker initiates a recovery process.  
   - Normally, this is a legitimate feature: if a user loses access, guardians can help recover control.  
   - In this case, the attacker generates a malicious recovery request that nominates their own address as the new wallet owner.  


3. **Bypassing 2FA (via Compromised Service)**  
   - Wallet recovery requires 2FA verification.  
   - However, the attacker has already compromised the 2FA service (e.g., through phishing, API exploit, or insider access).  
   - Using this foothold, they produce fraudulent 2FA codes to approve their malicious recovery request.  

4. **Executing Wallet Recovery**  
   - With the fake 2FA in hand, the attacker submits the recovery transaction.  
   - The Loopring system, trusting the compromised guardian + 2FA, transfers ownership of the wallet to the attacker‚Äôs address.  
   - At this point, the attacker has full control over the target wallet.  

5. **Draining Wallet Assets**  
   - The attacker enumerates the wallet‚Äôs holdings (ERC-20 tokens, NFTs, ETH, etc.).  
   - Assets are liquidated for ETH where possible (ERC-20 swaps, NFT fire sales).  
   - ETH is then transferred out to attacker-controlled wallets, making laundering easier.  

6. **Profit & Laundering**  
   - The attacker consolidates ETH across wallets.  
   - Funds are likely moved through mixers, exchanges, or cross-chain bridges to obscure origins.  
   - Victims are left with empty wallets, while attribution becomes difficult.  


### The Solution

So if the exploit wasn‚Äôt about breaking Solidity logic, and instead was about exploiting centralised dependencies (a single guardian and a compromised 2FA service), what's the solution?

Gathering more momentum this year, a structure similar to a multi-signature wallet (as demonstrated below), would prevent a single point of failure:

```Solidity
// SECURE: Multi-guardian configuration
function setupSecureRecovery(address wallet) external {
    // Distributed trust model
    GuardianConfig memory config = GuardianConfig({
        guardians: [
            userDefinedGuardian1,
            userDefinedGuardian2,
            hardwareWalletBackup,
            trustedFriendAddress
        ],
        threshold: 3, // Require 3-of-4 approval
        recoveryDelay: 72 hours // Longer delay for security
    });
    
    setGuardianConfiguration(wallet, config);
}
```

So what's the takeaway? This is a textbook case of secure defaults being ignored. If a system markets itself as "self-custodial," but the default guardian model leaves users exposed, then the security model is essentially setting users up to fail.

The loss totaled to: $5,013,991 (1,373 ETH equivalent) and large reputational damange for any  official Guardian wallet accounts.

## Snowflake SaaS Breach

Snowflake, a major SaaS data warehouse provider, was compromised. Web3 projects relying on Snowflake for analytics and infra were indirectly exposed.

This was particularly painful provided a centralised SaaS company, undermined decentralised protocols' primary advantage of safe data access and storage. The central takeaway was the phrase ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt use centralised infra‚Äù is usually a myth. From RPC endpoints to analytics dashboards, every protocol touches Web2 at some point. Attackers know it, and they‚Äôre pivoting.


### Simplified Infostealer flow (pseudocode)

At the heart of the incident was something brutally simple: stolen credentials. The exploiters leaned on an arsenal of infostealer malware to vacuum up passwords, wallet seeds, and session cookies from compromised contractor machines. Once inside, these harvested credentials gave them the keys to multiple Snowflake instances that Web3 projects relied on.  

The attacker‚Äôs workflow can be reduced to a few lines of code:

```python
malware_targets = [
    "browser_passwords", "crypto_wallet_seeds",
    "session_cookies", "system_credentials"
]

def harvest(system):
    creds = {}
    for target in malware_targets:
        creds[target] = extract_data(system, target)
    return creds

# Stolen creds later used to access Snowflake accounts
```


### Security Failures:
In summary critical security failures consist of:
- **Authentication:** No MFA, weak password policies, never-rotated credentials.  
- **Access Control:** No IP or geographic restrictions.  
- **Operational Security:** Shared machines, gaming/pirated software, poor environment isolation.  
- **Detection & Response:** Weeks-to-months delay, weak forensic readiness.  

The breach illustrates how Web3 security depends heavily on Web2 infrastructure. Attackers exploit these centralised weak links, making robust infra security (MFA, credential rotation, contractor isolation, and real monitoring) as critical as smart contract audits.
