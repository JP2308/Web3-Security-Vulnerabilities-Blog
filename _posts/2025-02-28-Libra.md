## zkLend: Starknet's First Major Test

zkLend's $6 million loss represents one of the first significant exploits on Starknet, providing an early test of both the network's security assumptions and its ecosystem's incident response capabilities. The attacker exploited vulnerabilities in the protocol's smart contract logic before attempting to launder funds through Railgun's privacy protocol.

### The Technical Challenge:
Starknet's Cairo programming language and zero-knowledge proof architecture create different security considerations compared to traditional EVM chains. This exploit demonstrates that moving to new execution environments doesn't eliminate smart contract vulnerabilities - it just changes the attack surface.

The fact that this represents one of Starknet's first major exploits means the ecosystem likely lacks the battle-tested security practices that more mature chains have developed through painful experience. Every new blockchain environment has to learn similar lessons about secure development practices.

### The Laundering Failure:
What's particularly interesting about this incident is how the attacker's laundering attempt failed when Railgun's anti-money laundering mechanisms flagged the transactions. This represents one of the few cases where privacy protocols have successfully prevented fund laundering rather than enabling it.
The technical details of how Railgun detected and blocked these transactions would be valuable for understanding how privacy and compliance can coexist in blockchain systems.
In my view, this incident highlights both the opportunities and challenges of deploying DeFi protocols on emerging Layer 2 networks. While these environments offer technical advantages, they also lack the security infrastructure and institutional knowledge that comes with ecosystem maturity

## MEV Bots – Exploits Across EVM Chains
The exploitation of multiple closed-source MEV bots across EVM chains represents an interesting development in the ongoing MEV wars. Attackers identified and exploited vulnerabilities in automated trading systems that were presumably designed to extract value from other users' transactions.

### The Irony Factor:
There's a certain poetic justice in MEV bots - which profit from exploiting transaction ordering and information asymmetries - being exploited themselves through code vulnerabilities. The hunters became the hunted when their own operational security proved inadequate. The closed-source nature of these bots makes it difficult to analyse the specific vulnerabilities, but the coordinated nature of the attacks across multiple chains suggests either systematic reconnaissance or shared vulnerability patterns across different bot implementations.

### The Technical Evolution:
This represents an escalation in the sophistication of attacks targeting blockchain infrastructure rather than just user-facing protocols. Attackers are moving up the value chain to target the tools and systems that other actors rely on for automated operations.

### Libra Memecoin – Rug Pull with Open Admission

**Incident Overview:**  
The Libra memecoin rug pull stands out not for its technical sophistication but for the team's brazen admission of their fraudulent activities. Rather than attempting to cover up their market manipulation and exit scam, they openly acknowledged their actions. This represents an unusual approach to exit scams where the perpetrators apparently decided that honest fraud was preferable to maintaining pretenses. Whether this was calculated psychological manipulation or simple arrogance, it demonstrates how normalised fraudulent behavior has become in certain corners of the memecoin ecosystem.

The open admission also raises interesting questions about legal implications. While most rug pulls involve teams disappearing and denying wrongdoing, this case provides clear evidence of intentional fraud that could facilitate prosecution efforts.
