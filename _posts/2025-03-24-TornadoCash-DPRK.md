In the week of March 24, 2025, the blockchain security landscape witnessed significant incidents, with over $8.6 million stolen across six separate events. The majority of these funds were siphoned from Zoth, which had previously experienced a $285K loss earlier in the month due to a smart contract exploit. This time, however, the platform suffered a full-blown $8.4 million private key compromise.

### 💥 Major Incidents

- **Zoth** – Following a prior exploit, Zoth faced a severe private key compromise, leading to the loss of $8.4M.
- **Aixbt** – An AI trading platform suffered a server breach, losing $100K.
- **Wemix** – Disclosed a $6.2M hack nearly a month after the incident, raising concerns about delayed transparency in the industry.

### 🕵️‍♂️ DPRK Laundering Tactics

North Korean threat actors have escalated their laundering operations, now employing sophisticated methods to obfuscate stolen funds, including:

- **Mixers** – Using tools like Wasabi, Tornado Cash (TC), and CryptoMixer.
- **Sandwich Transactions** – Employing MEV bots to create misleading transaction patterns, funneling funds to attacker-controlled block builders.

### 🌐 Tornado Cash Update

The U.S. government lifted sanctions on Tornado Cash following advocacy efforts. However, addresses associated with Tornado Cash developers remain sanctioned, indicating ongoing scrutiny and regulatory challenges.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- **Delayed Disclosures** – The Wemix incident underscores the risks of delayed public reporting. Timely disclosure is crucial for community protection.
- **Evolving Laundering Techniques** – The use of MEV bots and mixers by threat actors highlights the need for enhanced monitoring and detection.
- **Regulatory Landscape** – Tornado Cash demonstrates the dynamic nature of blockchain regulations; platforms must stay informed and compliant.
