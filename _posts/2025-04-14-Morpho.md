### üí• Morpho Labs Permit Exploit (~$2.6M)

**Incident Overview:**
- A front-end upgrade caused a misconfigured user flow: users were prompted to sign a transaction approving unlimited spending (‚Äúpermit‚Äù) to a multicall contract. The exploit allowed attackers to steal funds via that signed permission. 
- A whitehat MEV bot intercepted part of the exploit, reducing overall damage, but the incident underscores how UI flaws can bypass on-chain controls.

**Technical Analysis:**
- The problem is not with smart contract logic per se, but with **front-end trust assumptions**: users trust UI, but malicious or misconfigured UI can expose them.
- Unlimited permit functionality on ERC-20 / permit-enabled tokens must be handled with care; user prompts (in UI) must clearly show scope and limits.
- Use of ‚Äúmulticall‚Äù contracts exacerbates risk because one call might have many paths.

**Mitigation**
I would suggest a slight amendment to the code that looks like the following:

```solidity

// Example of unsafe unlimited permit
function approveUnlimited(address spender) external {
    _approve(msg.sender, spender, type(uint256).max);
}

// Safer capped approval pattern
function approveCapped(address spender, uint256 amount) external {
    require(amount <= MAX_APPROVAL, "Exceeds safe limit");
    _approve(msg.sender, spender, amount);
}

```
The practical effect being a cap on the amount that can be sent in the Defi context. I believe this to be the solution provided SushiSwap, and phishing-based UI attacks have previously reported a similar issue.


**Related Context:**
- Similar issues have occurred in other protocols: unlimited approvals have caused loss (e.g. SushiSwap rogue contracts, phishing UI attacks).
- Mitigation strategies: require autocomplete, transaction previews, hardware wallet confirmation, EIP-712 / other typed data signing.
