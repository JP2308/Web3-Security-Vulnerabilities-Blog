## üîê Blockchain Security Insights: RPC Vulnerabilities, CPI Exploits & Passkey Adoption

As blockchain ecosystems evolve, so do the tactics employed by malicious actors. Recent analyses have highlighted critical vulnerabilities in Polkadot's Gossamer node, Solana's Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs), and the emerging adoption of passkey authentication. This post delves into these findings and offers best practices for developers and users alike.

### üß™ 1. Polkadot Gossamer RPC Denial-of-Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities

FuzzingLabs conducted an in-depth analysis of Gossamer, a Go-based implementation of a Polkadot node developed by ChainSafe Systems. Their research identified several Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoints susceptible to Denial-of-Service attacks. By automating the invocation of these RPC methods with random parameters, they were able to trigger unexpected behaviors, leading to potential service disruptions.

**Key Findings:**

- Certain RPC methods, when provided with malformed or unexpected inputs, can cause the node to crash or become unresponsive.
- Lack of input validation and error handling in some RPC endpoints increases the attack surface.

**Recommendations:**

- Implement robust input validation and error handling mechanisms for all RPC endpoints.
- Regularly conduct fuzz testing to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
- Monitor node performance and set up alerts for unusual activities.

### üîÑ 2. Solana Arbitrary CPI Attack Vectors

Solana's Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs) allow programs to call other programs, enabling modular and composable smart contracts. However, this feature also introduces potential attack vectors. ImmuneBytes identified scenarios where malicious programs can exploit CPIs to execute unintended actions, such as unauthorised token transfers or state modifications.

**Key Findings:**

- Improper validation of CPI calls can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorised access.
- Malicious programs can manipulate CPI contexts to alter execution flow.

**Recommendations:**

- Ensure that all CPI calls are validated against a whitelist of trusted programs.
- Implement access control checks to restrict sensitive operations.
- Regularly audit and review CPI interactions to detect anomalous behaviors.

### üîë 3. Passkeys Explained: A Shift Towards Passwordless Authentication

Traditional passwords have long been a weak link in online security. Passkeys, a passwordless authentication method based on public-key cryptography, are emerging as a more secure alternative. Cantina's blog post provides an in-depth look at passkeys, their benefits, and best practices for implementation.

**Key Insights:**

- Passkeys eliminate the need for passwords, reducing the risk of phishing and credential stuffing attacks.
- They offer seamless authentication experiences across devices and platforms.
- Implementing passkeys requires support from both service providers and users' devices.

**Best Practices:**

- Encourage users to enable passkey authentication where supported.
- Service providers should integrate passkey support into their authentication systems.
- Educate users about the benefits and usage of passkeys to promote adoption.

## üß† Final Thoughts

The broader pattern across these developments is that blockchain security is becoming more sophisticated in both attack and defense capabilities. Infrastructure-level attacks, protocol mechanism exploits, and improved authentication systems all represent evolution beyond the smart contract bugs that dominated early blockchain security incidents.

In my view, this maturation suggests that blockchain security is finally developing the institutional knowledge and systematic approaches that characterise mature software security disciplines. The challenge now is ensuring that this knowledge is applied consistently across the rapidly expanding blockchain ecosystem.
