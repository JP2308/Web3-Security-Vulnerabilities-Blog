This week in Web3 security, attackers drained over $1.5M across seven incidents.  
What stood out to me were three very different types of attacks:  

1. A **supply chain attack** on Solana’s `web3.js` library.  
2. **Price and reward manipulation exploits** on smaller BNB Chain protocols.  
3. **Malware targeting Rabby wallets** in the BeaverTail campaign.  

Each of these reminded me of a simple truth: the weakest link in Web3 is never obvious until it breaks.

## 🔒 1. Solana Supply Chain Attack on `web3.js`

### Attack Vector  
- The **official Solana `web3.js` library** was compromised at the package level.  
- Malicious code was introduced and automatically pulled by developers updating dependencies.  
- Any wallet or dApp that integrated the poisoned version risked sending user funds to the attacker.  

### Technical Details  
- Attackers likely gained access to the library’s publishing pipeline.  
- The malicious code hooked into wallet transaction flows.  
- Early detection limited the blast radius, but the incident revealed how fragile the ecosystem is when dependencies aren’t verified.  

### My Take  
This one hit close to home. I rely on libraries like `web3.js` all the time, and honestly, I rarely think about the supply chain risk until something like this happens. It’s a reminder that “just updating” isn’t always safe — pin your versions, verify integrity, and don’t blindly trust even the most “official” repos.

## 🏦 2. BNB Chain Price & Reward Manipulation Exploits  

### Attack Vector  
- Multiple small projects (Vestra, Arata, MAAT, BYC, GAGAW, MFT) were exploited.  
- Attackers manipulated price oracles, liquidity pools, or reward distribution logic.  
- By inflating token values or tricking reward contracts, they extracted funds without providing real value.  

### Technical Details  
- Exploits included:  
  - Flash loan–driven price oracle manipulation.  
  - Poorly designed reward formulas allowing attackers to “loop” rewards.  
- These are typical in under-audited projects on BNB Chain.  

### My Take  
I wasn’t surprised to see this. Smaller BNB protocols are often rushed, under-audited, and sitting ducks for attackers. What *did* stand out to me was how preventable these were. Things like:  
- Using robust oracles (TWAPs, Chainlink).  
- Capping rewards and adding circuit breakers.  
- And my favorite: automatic invariant checks on fund transfers.  

By that, I mean rules baked into the protocol that enforce sanity at runtime — no negative balances, no unchecked reward loops, no breaking core assumptions. Basically, guardrails that make it harder to accidentally design something abusable.

## 💻 3. Rabby Wallet Malware (BeaverTail Campaign)  

### Attack Vector  
- BeaverTail malware specifically targeted Rabby wallet users.  
- It attempted to exfiltrate private keys and wallet credentials from infected devices.  

### Technical Details  
- Distributed as malicious software downloads.  
- Likely spread through phishing campaigns or trojanised applications.  
- Once installed, it injected itself into wallet processes and stole sensitive data.  

### My Take  
This was a reminder that no matter how secure your smart contract is, it doesn’t matter if the user’s laptop is already owned. I see too many people underestimate endpoint risk. The reality is: if malware has root, your wallet is toast. That’s why I keep hammering the same advice — use hardware wallets, verify what you install, and assume your device isn’t bulletproof.

## 🚨 Closing Thoughts

Looking back on these incidents, what jumps out to me is how *different* the weak points are:  
- **Dependencies** (supply chain).  
- **Protocol design** (oracle/reward manipulation).  
- **User endpoints** (wallet malware).  

To me, this proves Web3 security is a full-stack problem. It’s not enough to just audit smart contracts or lock down infra — we have to think about everything, from the libraries we import, to the economics we design, to the devices users carry in their pockets.  

And here’s my personal takeaway: security isn’t about being paranoid everywhere all at once — it’s about building habits. Audit dependencies, enforce invariants, and use hardware wallets. Those three alone would have blunted a lot of this week’s chaos.
