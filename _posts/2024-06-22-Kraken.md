# üîç Kraken Bug Bounty Incident: CertiK's Disclosure and Analysis

## üß© Incident Overview

**Attack Timeline:**
- **Late May 2024:** CertiK researcher begins experimenting with False Deposit exploit
- **June 5, 2024:** First successful fake deposit of a small amount
- **June 5-9, 2024:** Continued exploitation with 20+ transactions, stealing $3M+
- **During exploitation:** Deposits to Tornado Cash, cryptic amounts like 31337 ("elite")
- **June 9, 2024:** Kraken's Chief Security Officer, Nick Percoco, disclosed a critical vulnerability discovered through their bug bounty program. 

Naturally, the timing and manner of CertiK's public disclosure raised community concerns with questioning whether the public release was in the "best interest of Kraken users" or whether an ulterior motive was at play.

In my view, responsible disclosure should prioritise user safety over publicity. Bug bounties only work if researchers and platforms operate with mutual trust ‚Äî breaking that bond risks undermining the whole ecosystem.

## üí∏ Exploitation Drama

Some time after the exploit was discovered, allegations began to surface that suggested CertiK may have exploited the vulnerability before reporting it. What this looked like practically was potentially millions of dollars were withdrawn from Kraken's platform prior to disclosure. 

Kraken quickly returned withdrawn funds to affected users (minor fee deductions noted). However, even the suggestion of pre-disclosure exploitation is damaging irrespective of if funds were repaid or not. For me, this underlines a key lesson as an aspiring auditor: technical skill is meaningless without integrity. Exploitation under the banner of ‚Äúresearch‚Äù erodes the very trust security professionals are meant to protect.

However, a real positive to come from this was the call for clearly disclosure practices. Personally, I think Web3 is overdue for a formalised disclosure framework ‚Äî something closer to finance‚Äôs regulatory reporting, but adapted for open-source environments. Without it, each incident risks devolving into finger-pointing rather than constructive learning. Ironically, for a community based on transparency, a few actors seem to want to benefit from opaque reporting.
