### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è DPRK's Long Game: A Security Researcher Turned Threat Actor

It was uncovered that Nick L. Franklin, a previously respected figure in the blockchain security community, was actually a North Korean threat actor. Over the past year, Franklin had built trust within the community by regularly posting analyses of recent compromises and engaging with researchers. Only recently did he begin exploiting these connections by sharing malware-laced vulnerability reports.

**Key Takeaways:**

- DPRK actors are playing an even longer game, using trust as a weapon.
- DPRK has smart contract exploitation capabilities but uses them selectively.
- OpenZeppelin, Hyperliquid, 1inch, and others appear to be on DPRK‚Äôs target list.
- Security researchers, including SEAL team, are now targets.

### üí• Exploits in DeFi: New Attack Techniques Emerging

Several high-profile exploits shook DeFi this week:

- **SIR Trading ($355K loss):** This hack leveraged the newly introduced EVM transient storage feature. The attacker exploited a collision between the pool address and transfer amount, using a vanity address to overwrite the amount.

- **Abracadabra ($13M loss):** Hit by a complex borrowing/liquidation exploit resembling past Euler and KyberSwap compromises. Stolen funds remain scattered across multiple addresses and haven‚Äôt been laundered yet. Abracadabra is offering a massive 25% bounty‚Äîlet‚Äôs see if the attacker takes it.

Detailed breakdowns of these and other exploits‚ÄîHyperliquid/Jelly, Alkimiya, and more‚Äîare available in the premium section.

### üß† Key Takeaways

- **Trust is a Weapon:** The infiltration of a respected security researcher underscores the importance of verifying the credentials and intentions of individuals in the blockchain community.

- **Evolving Attack Techniques:** The use of advanced features like EVM transient storage and complex borrowing mechanisms in attacks highlights the need for continuous innovation in security measures.

- **Community Vigilance:** The community must remain vigilant and skeptical, even of well-known figures, to protect against sophisticated infiltration tactics.
