## Overview

This week, more than $26 million in value was lost across six incidents.  
The most notable events involved:

- Roughly $13.5M drained from Venus Protocol users due to wallet compromises  
- $8.4M lost at Bunni V2 through a subtle rounding flaw in their Liquidity Distribution Function (LDF)  

Not every story ended in disaster. In one Venus incident, governance actions and rapid response mechanisms enabled a full recovery — highlighting how much resilience depends not only on smart contract logic, but also on protocol-level crisis playbooks.

## Venus Protocol — Wallet Compromise and Fast Governance Response

A compromised Zoom call led to a user unknowingly exposing their wallet through a malicious client. With control of the wallet, the attacker attempted to exploit collateral positions in Venus Protocol.  

The key moment was the protocol’s response: Venus governance acted within hours. A pause mechanism was triggered before the position could be fully drained, and an emergency proposal was passed to force-liquidate the stolen collateral. The attacker’s advantage was neutralised, and affected users recovered in full.  

The episode illustrates a critical truth in DeFi: even when end users fall victim to social engineering, strong governance structures and emergency controls can limit systemic fallout. Security is not just about code, but about the ability to coordinate quickly under stress.

## Bunni V2 — Compounding Rounding Errors

Bunni V2’s incident shows how edge-state conditions in protocol logic can be weaponised. Their Liquidity Distribution Function (LDF) was designed with conservative rounding rules, intended to slightly favor the protocol.  

Attackers discovered that by deliberately pushing pool balances to extreme lows — as little as 26 wei — the rounding behavior created small but consistent advantages. By cycling this exploit repeatedly, those tiny discrepancies compounded into millions of dollars in profit.  

The lesson is clear: even logic that looks safe in normal ranges can break down when pushed into unusual states. Rounding, precision assumptions, and invariant math all need to be stress-tested at the edges, not just under typical scenarios.

## Other Incidents

- OlaXBT suffered a key/signing compromise on Ethereum, resulting in a loss of around $2M.  
- Additional smaller incidents across other protocols contributed to the remainder of the week’s $26M in losses, though public reporting has been limited.

## Takeaways

This week’s exploits underline several recurring themes in Web3 security:

- Social engineering remains one of the most effective attack vectors, bypassing smart contract defenses entirely.  
- Governance speed and flexibility can determine whether an exploit results in partial recovery or total loss.  
- Small errors in logic — particularly those involving rounding, precision, or edge-case math — can scale into multi-million dollar vulnerabilities when exploited systematically.  

Auditors and protocol developers alike need to expand their focus: securing key infrastructure, preparing recovery playbooks, and testing logic under extreme conditions are no longer optional. They’re the difference between resilience and ruin.
