## Genesis Global Trading Hack – $238M Stolen

### Overview

Genesis Global Trading suffered a major security breach resulting in $238 million stolen, with funds quickly laundered across multiple platforms. ([BlockThreat](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-34-2024?utm_source=substack&publication_id=8105&post_id=148591576&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&utm_campaign=email-share&isFreemail=true&r=30d2a8))  

**Key Laundering Platforms:**
- Railgun (privacy tool)  
- ChangeNow  
- eXch  
- Avalanche Bridge  
- ThorChain  

The use of Railgun, a privacy mixer, allowed attackers to obscure the origin of stolen funds, highlighting the dual-use nature of privacy protocols in DeFi.

### Technical Insights

- **Rapid fund movement:** Funds moved through multiple chains in minutes, exploiting cross-chain bridges.  
- **Privacy tool exploitation:** Railgun’s privacy features, intended for legitimate use, were leveraged for money laundering.  
- **Risk amplification:** Large sums traversing multiple protocols increase attack surface and complicate forensic tracking.  

### Technical Reality

Each hop in this laundering chain serves a specific purpose. Railgun provides transaction privacy, ChangeNow avoids KYC requirements, cross-chain bridges complicate forensic tracking, and ThorChain enables conversion between different assets. It's not random — it's methodical.

This creates an uncomfortable question for the DeFi ecosystem: how do you preserve privacy and permissionlessness while preventing large-scale money laundering? The same tools that protect legitimate users also enable sophisticated criminals.

## Seif Wallet Data Exposure

### Overview

The Seif Wallet incident is the kind of mistake that makes you question basic operational security practices. Somehow, user private keys and passwords ended up being sent to a third-party analytics vendor. Not transaction data or usage metrics — actual private keys that could drain wallets. ([BlockThreat](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-34-2024?utm_source=substack&publication_id=8105&post_id=148591576&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&utm_campaign=email-share&isFreemail=true&r=30d2a8))

- **Vulnerability Detected:** July 25, 2024  
- **Patched:** July 26, 2024  
- **Public Disclosure:** August 20, 2024  

No official communication was posted on Discord, creating a trust gap with users.

### Technical Insights

- **Data leak vector:** Likely due to API misconfiguration or insufficient access controls.  
- **Exfiltrated data:** Private keys and sensitive credentials, which could directly compromise wallets.  
- **Delayed disclosure risk:** Failure to promptly inform users increases exposure to phishing and secondary attacks.

### Lessons Learned

Immediate disclosure protocols are critical to maintain trust in decentralised applications. But also, this represents a fundamental misunderstanding of data classification. Private keys aren't just sensitive data — they're the digital equivalent of someone's bank account access. Sending them to analytics vendors is like mailing your banking passwords to a marketing company.

## Parcl – DNS Hijacking & Account Takeover

### Overview

Parcl suffered a sophisticated dual compromise, including DNS hijacking and social account takeover (website and X/Twitter). ([BlockThreat](https://newsletter.blockthreat.io/p/blockthreat-week-34-2024?utm_source=substack&publication_id=8105&post_id=148591576&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&utm_campaign=email-share&isFreemail=true&r=30d2a8))  

The post-mortem suggests possible insider involvement, given the coordinated nature of the attack.

### Technical Insights

- **DNS hijacking:** Allowed redirection of legitimate traffic to malicious servers, potentially exposing user credentials.  
- **Social account compromise:** Coordinated access to Twitter/X enabled phishing and misinformation campaigns.  
- **Multi-vector risk:** Insider knowledge can amplify the impact of external threats.

### Lessons Learned

1. Protect both **infrastructure and administrative access** to prevent internal/external exploits.  
2. Implement **multi-factor authentication** and **role-based access controls**.  
3. Regularly **audit DNS records and domain registrar accounts** to detect unauthorised changes.
