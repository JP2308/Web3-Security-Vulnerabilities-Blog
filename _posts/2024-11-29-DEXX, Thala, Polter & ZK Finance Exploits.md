# ðŸ’¥ Web3 Security Roundup: $60M+ Lost Across Multiple Incidents

This week saw **over $60 million stolen** across six major Web3 security incidents. Smart contract exploitation has returned with a vengeance. Attack vectors ranged from price oracle and reward manipulation to function parameter validation flaws and private key theft. Below, we break down the most notable compromises and their technical details.

## 1. DEXX Private Key Theft â€“ $21M on Solana

DEXX managed to lose $21 million by implementing the worst possible approach to private key management: storing user keys on their servers. This created a single point of failure that attackers exploited to drain over 900 user wallets across Solana.

### The Technical Reality:

DEXX positioned itself as a trading terminal for memecoins but chose to handle private key management like it was 2010. When you store thousands of users' private keys in a central database, you're not building a decentralised trading platform â€” you're building a honeypot for hackers.

**Attack Flow**
1. Hackers gained access to DEXX's private key database
2. Used compromised keys to drain user wallets systematically
3. Redirected funds to attacker-controlled Solana addresses
4. Affected 900+ users for $21M total damage



### The Fundamental Problem
Any system that requires server-side private key storage isn't Web3 â€” it's traditional fintech with blockchain window dressing. The entire point of self-custody is that users control their own keys, not that platforms control keys on users' behalf.

DEXX's approach violated the most basic principle of cryptocurrency: not your keys, not your crypto. They essentially recreated the custody model that crypto was designed to eliminate, then acted surprised when centralised key storage became a massive vulnerability.

## 2. Thala DeFi Exploit â€“ $25.5M on Aptos
Thala Protocol on Aptos lost $25.5 million because their v1 farming contract forgot to implement access controls for LP token withdrawals. Attackers could withdraw tokens without authorisation through a vulnerability that should have been caught in basic code review.


### Technical Details:
Thala's farming contract allowed anyone to withdraw LP tokens without verifying ownership or authorisation. This is equivalent to building a bank vault and forgetting to install locks on the deposit boxes. I suppose the issues can be broken down into:
1. Rushed deployment without comprehensive testing
2. No bug bounty program to incentivise vulnerability discovery
3. Limited community review of critical contract functions
4. Missing access control validation in withdrawal functions

What's notable about Thala's response is how they handled the recovery. They managed to freeze $11.5 million in assets and negotiated with the attacker to return the stolen funds in exchange for a $300,000 bounty. While paying hackers isn't ideal, it's better than losing the entire $25.5 million.

Access control isn't an advanced security feature â€” it's table stakes for any system handling financial assets. The fact that Thala deployed a farming contract without proper authorisation checks suggests fundamental gaps in their development and review processes.

## 3. Polter Finance Oracle Manipulation â€“ $7M on Fantom
Polter Finance lost $7 million to LP price oracle manipulation, demonstrating that the DeFi space still hasn't learned how to build manipulation-resistant pricing systems. Attackers used flash loans to manipulate pool prices and feed false data to the protocol's oracles.

**Attack Flow**
1. Take flash loan to manipulate LP pool prices
2. Feed manipulated prices to Polter's oracle system
3. Use inflated asset valuations to withdraw $7M from vaults
4. Repay flash loan and profit from the price discrepancy

This attack vector has been exploited dozens of times across different DeFi protocols, yet teams keep implementing price oracles that can be manipulated within a single transaction. The pattern is so common it should be automatically flagged by security auditing tools.
In my view, any DeFi protocol that uses manipulatable price feeds for critical financial decisions is fundamentally unsafe. Oracle manipulation isn't a sophisticated attack technique â€” it's a well-documented vulnerability with established mitigation strategies.



## 4. ZK Finance Hardcoded Price Exploit â€“ WBTC at $58K
ZK Finance hardcoded WBTC at $58,000, apparently deciding that dynamic price feeds were too complex for their system. Attackers exploited the price discrepancy to execute profitable trades against the protocol's mispriced assets.

This might be the most embarrassing vulnerability of the bunch. Hardcoding asset prices in DeFi protocols is like hardcoding exchange rates in international banking â€” it's guaranteed to create arbitrage opportunities for anyone paying attention to market prices.

The fact that a protocol handling real user funds thought static pricing was acceptable suggests either fundamental misunderstanding of how financial markets work or complete disregard for basic risk management principles.
