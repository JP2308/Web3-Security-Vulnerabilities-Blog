## üß† Overview

On 20 July the ETHTrustFund project executed an exit scam on Coinbase's Base Layer 2 network, resulting in the theft of ~$2.1 million from investors. The project's developer, known only as "Peng," disappeared after months of activity, leaving investors with significant losses.

ETHTrustFund positioned itself as a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) implementing rebasing mechanisms and blockchain-based bonds, drawing inspiration from the OlympusDAO (OHM) model. The project promised high returns and a mechanism to "debase" its ETF tokens, allegedly increasing the value of remaining tokens. Investors were enticed by these promises and deposited their ETH into the project's treasury.

## üõ†Ô∏è Exploit Details

The exploit unfolded as follows:

1. **Initial Deposits**: Users deposited their ETH into the ETHTrustFund treasury, believing they were investing in a legitimate project.

2. **Developer's Disappearance**: After months of activity, the developer, "Peng," suddenly ceased communication, deleting social media accounts and the project's official Telegram channel.

3. **Fund Transfer**: The project's treasury address, [0xF259F01C40C211D63Ab75A6d2B108B364EFaB780](https://basescan.org/address/0xF259F01C40C211D63Ab75A6d2B108B364EFaB780), transferred funds to a new wallet address, [0x374f4BD39aD211e67e0f8Cb8Ebf1b4F6Ac3059aD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x374f4BD39aD211e67e0f8Cb8Ebf1b4F6Ac3059aD).

4. **Token Swaps and Bridging**: The stolen $BRETT tokens were swapped for ETH and bridged from Base to Ethereum.

5. **Fund Obfuscation**: The attacker moved funds through privacy protocols like Railgun and Tornado Cash to obfuscate the origin of the stolen assets.

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation and Recommendations

To mitigate similar risks in the future, the following best practices are recommended:

- **Thorough Due Diligence**: Investors should conduct comprehensive research before investing in DeFi projects, including reviewing the project's code, audits, and team background.

- **Transparency**: Projects should maintain clear and open communication with their community, providing regular updates and being responsive to inquiries.

- **Security Audits**: Projects should undergo rigorous security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## üß† Conclusion

The ETHTrustFund exit scam on Base Network serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with investing in unverified DeFi projects. While the project's promises were enticing, the lack of transparency and the developer's sudden disappearance led to significant financial losses for investors. This incident underscores the importance of conducting thorough research and exercising caution when engaging with DeFi projects.
