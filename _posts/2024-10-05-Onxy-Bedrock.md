# September 2024 DeFi Bloodbath: $15M+ Lost in Protocol Exploits

September 2024 delivered another painful lesson in DeFi security fundamentals, with over $15 million drained from protocols that should have known better. Shezmu lost $4.9 million to a botched contract upgrade, while Onyx Protocol proved that forking Compound without maintaining security updates is expensive stupidity. We're talking about access control failures, unaudited upgrades, and exploiting known vulnerabilities that have been public knowledge for years. The crypto space keeps making the same mistakes while handling increasingly large amounts of other people's money.

## Shezmu: When Contract Upgrades Go Wrong
Shezmu managed to lose $4.9 million because they deployed a September 3rd contract upgrade without proper security review, creating a vulnerability that allowed unauthorised minting of ShezUSD without required collateral. The attackers essentially convinced the protocol to mint collateral out of thin air, then used that fake collateral to borrow real assets.

### The Attack Flow:

1. Exploit flawed September contract upgrade
2. Mint unauthorised collateral through access control bypass
3. Use fake collateral to borrow $4.9M worth of real assets
4. Cash out before anyone notices

What's notable about Shezmu's response is how quickly they moved to negotiate with the attacker. They offered a 10% bounty for returning 90% of the stolen funds within 24 hours, ultimately recovering about 80% of the total loss. While losing $1 million to a bounty payment stings, it's better than losing the entire $4.9 million.

### The Real Problem:
Contract upgrades are high-risk operations that require comprehensive security review. The fact that Shezmu pushed a major upgrade without catching this vulnerability suggests inadequate testing and review processes. When you're handling millions in user funds, "deploy and pray" isn't a valid strategy. This incident demonstrates why protocol upgrades should be treated with the same scrutiny as initial deployments. Every change introduces potential vulnerabilities, and the complexity of upgrade mechanisms creates additional attack vectors.

## Onyx Protocol: Known Vulnerabilities Strike Again
Onyx Protocol lost $2.1 million to a vulnerability that has been exploited multiple times across different Compound forks. This represents the second time Onyx has been hit by essentially the same attack, suggesting they either don't understand the vulnerability or don't care enough to fix it.

### The Fork Problem:
When you fork established protocols like Compound, you inherit both their features and their vulnerabilities. Onyx's last audit was in January 2022, but they've continued pushing code changes without comprehensive security reviews of the modifications. This creates a dangerous pattern where protocols benefit from the reputation of battle-tested codebases while failing to maintain security parity with upstream fixes and patches.

### The Math of Negligence:
A comprehensive security audit might cost $50-100K. Onyx lost $2.1 million to a known vulnerability. That's a 20-40x negative ROI on skipping proper security review.


## Conclusion
I think this week's incidents highlight a fundamental maturity problem in DeFi. Teams are building financial infrastructure with software development practices that wouldn't be acceptable for a basic web application. Contract upgrades without security review and forking code without maintaining security updates are failures of basic operational discipline. The $15 million in losses could have been prevented with established security practices that cost a fraction of what protocols ended up paying in bounties and lost funds. Until the DeFi space treats security as a core engineering discipline rather than an optional add-on, we'll keep seeing the same preventable failures repeated across different protocols. The fact that Onyx got exploited twice using essentially the same vulnerability shows that some teams aren't learning from their mistakes. That's not a technology problem - it's a priorities problem.
