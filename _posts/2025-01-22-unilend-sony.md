## UniLend – $200K Exploit

UniLend managed to lose $200K because their token redemption process couldn't properly calculate share prices, allowing attackers to manipulate the system and trick the protocol into miscalculating collateral values. This is the kind of fundamental error that makes you question whether anyone actually tested the core financial functions before deploying.

### The Technical Problem:
The exploit involved manipulating the share price during token redemption, which then led to incorrect collateral value calculations by the protocol. Essentially, the attacker convinced UniLend that their collateral was worth more than it actually was, allowing them to extract value through the discrepancy.
This represents a failure of basic financial logic validation. When you're building lending protocols, the math that determines collateral values and redemption rates needs to be bulletproof. Getting these calculations wrong doesn't just create user experience problems - it creates arbitrage opportunities that attackers will inevitably exploit.

In my view, this incident highlights why DeFi protocols need to treat financial calculations with the same rigor as traditional financial institutions. You wouldn't deploy a banking system without thoroughly testing interest rate calculations, yet DeFi protocols routinely push code with untested financial logic.

### The Real Cost:
While $200K isn't massive by current DeFi standards, it represents a complete failure of testing and validation processes. Any lending protocol should have comprehensive test suites that verify financial calculations under various market conditions and attack scenarios.

## Sony’s Soneium Blockchain – Censorship Backlash

Sony's Soneium blockchain attempted to implement censorship mechanisms at the sequencer level, only to discover that users could simply bypass their controls by submitting transactions directly through Layer 1. This created a backlash from the community and demonstrated fundamental misunderstanding of how blockchain censorship resistance actually works.

### The Technical Reality:
Layer 2 solutions like Soneium rely on Layer 1 for final settlement, which means users can always bypass Layer 2 censorship by going directly to the base layer. Sony's attempt to control transactions at the sequencer level was essentially building a dam with a giant hole in it. This incident reveals either technical incompetence or willful misrepresentation of how their blockchain would operate. Any competent blockchain developer should understand that Layer 2 censorship can be bypassed through Layer 1 transactions.

### The Community Response:
The backlash from the crypto community was swift and predictable. Censorship resistance is one of the core value propositions of blockchain technology, and Sony's attempt to implement centralised control mechanisms was seen as fundamentally antithetical to decentralised principles. I think this demonstrates why traditional corporations often struggle when entering the crypto space. They try to apply traditional business models and control mechanisms to technologies specifically designed to resist those approaches.

## BSC's Small Fish Problem
Binance Smart Chain has become a hunting ground for attackers targeting small TVL projects with predictable security vulnerabilities. The pattern has become so common that attackers are apparently congratulating each other for being first to exploit newly deployed projects.

### The Targeting Logic:
Small projects on BSC often have minimal security budgets, limited audit coverage, and deploy using template code with known vulnerabilities. This creates a target-rich environment where attackers can systematically exploit similar weaknesses across multiple projects.
The competitive aspect - where attackers race to be first to exploit new projects - suggests this has become a profitable and repeatable attack pattern. It's basically industrialised vulnerability exploitation.

### The Systemic Problem:
This trend indicates that the barrier to entry for deploying DeFi protocols has become too low relative to the security requirements. Teams can deploy financial infrastructure without understanding basic security principles or having resources for proper audits.
The fact that attackers are finding this lucrative enough to compete over suggests the problem is likely to get worse before it gets better. Easy targets will continue attracting opportunistic attackers until the cost of deployment includes mandatory security measures
