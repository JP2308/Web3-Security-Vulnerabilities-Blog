# 🔍 Analyzing Blockchain Security: Opcode Fuzzing and MEV Attacks

## 🧪 Trail of Bits: Detecting Mispriced Opcodes with Fuzzing

On 17 June, Trail of Bits published a blog post detailing their approach to identifying mispriced opcodes in the Fuel Virtual Machine (VM) through fuzzing techniques.

By developing a custom fuzzing harness using LibAFL (basically, a testing environment that automatically feeds lots of random/mutated inputs into a program to try to make it fail in unexpected ways) and integrating it with the existing cargo-fuzz setup (built in Rust, meaning the runs can be implemented way faster), they achieved a significant increase in fuzzing performance, executing approximately 1,000 executions per second on an eight-core machine. This enhancement allowed for more effective detection of opcodes that charged insufficient gas fees, potentially leading to economic vulnerabilities in the Fuel network.

The fuzzing setup utilised compiled Sway programs as seed inputs (it started from valid smart contracts, mutated them, then fed into the program to see how much gas was used), enabling detection of underpriced opcodes by analyzing gas usage statistics. This method provides a scalable approach to auditing smart contract platforms, ensuring that gas estimations align with actual execution costs and preventing potential exploits.

This is a really cool development because it targets the very subtle risks of blockchain, gas mispricing. In essence, if gas is too cheap for certain operations, attackers can endlessly abuse them at little cost, leading to denial of service or draining validator resources. Further, the methodology used here is pretty profound as it moves from synthetic fuzzing, to actual realistic smart contracts being deployed.

## 🥪 Sandwiched.me: Real-Time Monitoring of MEV Attacks on Solana

Sandwiched.me offers a real-time dashboard that tracks and analyses Miner Extractable Value (MEV) attacks on the Solana blockchain. Their platform provides detailed insights into sandwich attacks, where malicious actors manipulate transaction ordering to profit at the expense of regular users.

One notable example is a sandwich attack involving a victim swapping SOL for ONLYGROK, resulting in a profit of 11.2165 SOL for the attacker. Such incidents highlight the ongoing challenges in DeFi ecosystems, where transaction ordering can be exploited for financial gain.

This speaks to me because real-time sandwich attacks illustrate that MEV is an inescapable friction in DeFi. Even minor transaction misorderings can create outsized losses. Transparency tools like Sandwiched.me are essential for informed protocol design. I've left a link below to explore the dashboard.
