In December 2024, three major exploits rocked the DeFi ecosystem: Spectral (Syntax Agents), Clipper Exchange, and Vestra DAO.  Together, these incidents drained nearly $1M+ in assets and exposed recurring vulnerabilities across approval logic, API handling, and DAO governance.


## ðŸ§© Exploit 1: Spectral (Syntax Agents) Approval Exploit

**Date/Time:** Dec-20-2024  
**Losses:** ~14,793 SPEC (~$250K)  
**Network:** Base  
**Attack Type:** Infinite Approval + Bonding Curve Manipulation  
**Source:** [Spectral Labs Announcement](https://x.com/Spectral_Labs/status/1863212410070253824)

### Vulnerability

- `AgentBalances.sol` was given **unrestricted allowance** to move tokens from `AutonomousAgentDeployer.sol`.  
- Root cause: **logic oversight in `transferFrom` + tax mechanism**, which unintentionally granted infinite approvals.  
- Attackers could abuse `deposit()` to drain liquidity.

### Attack Execution

1. **Flash Loan Setup** â€“ Borrow SPEC.  
2. **Swap SPEC â†’ AgentToken** â€“ via `swapExactSPECForTokens`.  
3. **Swap Back** â€“ Faulty `transferFrom` grants infinite approval.  
4. **Deposit Abuse** â€“ Call `deposit()` on `AgentBalances.sol`, draining balances.  
5. **Bonding Curve Manipulation** â€“ XYK mispriced AgentToken after liquidity drained.  
6. **SPEC Extraction** â€“ Small AgentToken deposits drained large amounts of SPEC.

### Impact

- ~14,793 SPEC stolen (~$250K).  
- All unbonded Syntax agents compromised.  

### Remediation

- Remove infinite approvals.  
- Restrict `deposit()` usage to deployer.  
- Reset bonding curve state.  
- Launch bug bounty program.

## ðŸ§© Exploit 2: Clipper Pool Imbalance Exploit

**Date/Time:** Dec-24-2024, ~04:00 AM â€“ 05:00 PM GMT  
**Losses:** ~$457,878  
**Networks:** Optimism & Base  
**Attack Type:** Single-Asset Deposit/Withdrawal Manipulation  
**Source:** [Clipper Post-Mortem](https://blog.clipper.exchange/clipper-dec-24-exploit-post-mortem/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Vulnerability

- Clipper supported **single-asset deposits/withdrawals** for UX.  
- But invariant checks (present for swaps) were **missing** here.  
- API signatures for deposits/withdrawals stayed valid even after pool state changes.  
- Small pools (low k values) = highly manipulable.

### Attack Execution

1. **Signature Harvesting** â€“ Spammed deposit signature requests via API.  
2. **Pool Manipulation** â€“ Swapped assets to imbalance pools while holding signed deposits.  
3. **Withdrawals** â€“ Used stale signatures to withdraw more than deposited.  
4. **Chained Transactions** â€“ Combined deposits/withdrawals for max extraction.

### Impact

- **Optimism Pool:** dropped from ~$318,710 â†’ ~$22,908.  
- **Base Pool:** dropped from ~$197,790 â†’ ~$35,714.  
- **Total Loss:** ~$457K.

### Remediation

- Add invariant checks to *all* flows (not just swaps).  
- Restrict/expire API signatures.  
- Patch circuit-breaker logic.  
- Strengthen monitoring.  
- Engage Hypernative, Quantstamp, SEAL 911.

## ðŸ§© Exploit 3: Vestra DAO Treasury Manipulation

**Date/Time:** Dec-2024  
**Losses:** ~$100K+ (ETH + tokens)  
**Source:** [Vestra DAO Post-Mortem](https://x.com/Vestra_DAO/status/1864677381459390781)

### Vulnerability

- Treasury multisig contracts had **misconfigured permissions**.  
- Certain functions allowed **re-entry into governance execution paths**.  
- Flaw in timelock + proposal execution enabled unauthorised asset movements.

### Attack Execution

1. **Proposal Injection** â€“ Malicious governance proposal crafted.  
2. **Execution Oversight** â€“ Timelock validation failed, proposal executed.  
3. **Asset Drain** â€“ DAO treasury drained to attacker addresses.

### Impact

- ~$100K lost.  
- Community trust and governance credibility damaged.  

### Remediation

- Treasury migrated to **Gnosis Safe** with strict signers.  
- Timelock validation patched.  
- Independent auditors engaged.  
- New community governance safeguards added.

## ðŸ”Ž Cross-Exploit Takeaways

1. **Infinite Approvals & Signature Reuse** remain dominant vectors.  
2. **APIs & Governance** can be just as dangerous as smart contracts.  
3. **Invariant Enforcement** must apply everywhere, not just swaps.  
4. **Small Liquidity Pools** are highly exploitable.  
5. **Audits + Bug Bounties** are not optional at scale.
